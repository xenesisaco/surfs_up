# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to see if the surf shop is a viable business all year round in this area. The data is sourced from two separate queries, one for December and the other for June.  After the queries are run, we store the temperatures and place them as data frames, which you can see below.

# Results

1) June’s max temp was 85 degrees, with 75% of the time begin around 77 degrees. The minimum temperature was 64 degrees, leaving us with an average/mean temperature of 74 degrees. 
Depending on where you are from, that seems pretty chilly for summer temperatures! However, if most of the time the temperature is 77 degrees, this may be a good temperature for summer.

2) Looking at December, we have a max of 83 degrees, with 75% of the time being 74 degrees. If you’re from the north, this is actually really decent weather for winter. 
3) The minimum temperature was 56 degrees, however, 25% of the time it was 69 degrees and nothing was reported lower. Which means 56 degrees is an anomaly.

# Summary

This maybe a viable choice of business for the area. Although summer is not extremely hot, the weather in both June and December seems consistent. Yes, December does get colder, but only by a few degrees. In December, it even has reached to 83 degrees (MAX). The average difference in degrees between both months is only off by 3 degrees.
Overall, in order to conduct an appropriate analysis, we would need to compare all of the months to each other because summer time here may not be summer time in Oahu. 
We can perform the following plots by month with more data to see if there is a consistent temperature range:

Also, we may need to see the precipitation amount. If the precipitation amount is high, then more people will avoid going outside. Thus, less surfing.
